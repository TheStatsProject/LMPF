"Economic Insights: The Untold Story of Mexican Migrant Labor and Their Transformative Impact on U.S. GDP—Unpacking President Sheinbaum's Bold Assertions"
============================================================

In a time when misinformation spreads faster than facts, separating myth from reality has never been more crucial. Following President Claudia Sheinbaum's recent `comments <https://www.gob.mx/presidencia/prensa/las-y-los-migrantes-contribuyen-a-la-economia-de-estados-unidos-presidenta-claudia-sheinbaum-en-2024-aportaron-al-pib-781-mil-mdd>`_ on employment, migration, foreign trade, and economic history, a vital question resurfaces:

What is the true economic impact of Mexican immigrants in the United States?

To answer this question, we went straight to the source by analyzing data from the `U.S. Census Bureau <https://www.census.gov/>`_ and the `Federal Reserve's FRED <https://fred.stlouisfed.org>`_ database. The findings we uncovered may challenge common narratives, and believe me, they will.

This is a fact-based analysis, based solely on official U.S. government sources. No opinions or manipulations, just the numbers that matter, just the raw facts. Nothing else, just science to restore balance.

**Recommended Readings**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


1. **Introductory/Basic Level**  
   *Introduction to the Economics of Immigration in OECD Countries*  
   **Author(s):** Institute of Labor Economics `Discussion Paper No. 13755 <https://docs.iza.org/dp13755.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com>`_

   This paper analyzes the impact of migration on the labor market and GDP in OECD countries. It explains in a simple way how to measure the contribution of immigrants to aggregate output, focusing on employment share rather than total population. Despite being a 2018 paper, it is a starting point for understanding the calculations developed.

2. **Intermediate/Medium Level**  
   *Rethinking the Benefits of Immigration: Theory and Evidence from the U.S.*  
   **Author(s):** Gianmarco I.P. Ottaviano and Giovanni Peri `NATIONAL BUREAU OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH Working Paper No. 11672 <https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w11672/w11672.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com>`_

   This work is another good reference for understanding the meaning of the calculations performed in this article. It develops a two-sector macroeconomic model where natives and immigrants are imperfect substitutes. It then uses data from the Census/American Community Survey—extremely similar to the way we constructed the database—to empirically estimate the contribution each worker makes to GDP.

3. **Advanced/Specialized Level**  
   *Immigration and Economic Growth*  
   **Author:** George J. Borjas `NATIONAL BUREAU OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH Working Paper 25836 <https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w25836/w25836.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com>`_

   This analysis provides a rigorous macro- and micro-level framework that links immigration inflows to changes in GDP growth rates and labor productivity, in close agreement with GDP projections for 2025 and GDP per worker that we estimated. It uses a formal model where :math:`GDP = f(K, L)`. to be linear-homogeneous. This allows for the decomposition of output per worker according to the proportion of native-born and immigrant workers, thereby making it possible to more accurately measure the sensitivity of the effects on GDP of an increase or decrease in immigrants.


**Data Sources**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


1. **U.S. Census Bureau**: Provides population data for native and foreign-born groups.
2. **FRED ST Louis**: Supplies GDP and labor force participation rates.
3. **Custom Analysis**: Estimates GDP contributions by nationality based on labor force participation rates and official population statistics.

**Steps**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


- Fetch and analyze GDP data for 2024 and project it forward to 2025, the FRED series (“Real Gross Domestic Product”) is reported in chained 2017 dollars, meaning 2017  is the reference (base) year for the inflation‐adjusted series for this article.
- Estimate labor force participation for native and foreign-born populations.
- Calculate GDP contributions by nationality and project future trends.
- Visualize results through interactive charts and tables.

Key Findings: Migrant Myths vs. Reality
-------------------------

As we mentioned, we will analyze the statements made by President Claudia Sheinbaum through a report published on the Mexican government's official website, which you can consult `here <https://www.gob.mx/presidencia/prensa/las-y-los-migrantes-contribuyen-a-la-economia-de-estados-unidos-presidenta-claudia-sheinbaum-en-2024-aportaron-al-pib-781-mil-mdd>`_. 

Based on that report, we have found the following:

1. **Migrant Labor Force Participation**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   - In 2024, Mexicans born in the U.S. contributed $781 billion to the Gross Domestic Product (GDP), meaning that if they were an independent country, they would currently be the tenth largest economy in the world; while forecasts indicate that the Latino community could occupy third place in two or three years.

2. **Contributions**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   - In 2022, undocumented immigrants paid nearly $100 billion in taxes, including $25.7 billion to Social Security; $6.4 billion to Medicare; and $1.8 billion to unemployment insurance.
   - They complement the U.S. workforce in essential industries, as their workforce represents 51 percent of dairy farms and meat processing; 20 percent of manufacturing and agriculture; 15 percent of education and healthcare; 28 percent of healthcare assistants; and 25 percent of construction workers. and 54.3 percent of agricultural sorters.

3. **Security**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   - Immigrants have 60 percent less crime, and the states along the border with Mexico are safer and healthier compared to the northern border of the United States.

4. **Invesment and Entrepreneurship**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   - In 2021, one in five immigrants was an entrepreneur, generating $95.6 billion.

Let there be no misunderstanding about the purpose of this analysis, which is to show the general public the importance of science and the real data offered by the entities responsible for providing it. In an era of misinformation, clarity in calculations is essential, as you will see in the following points. There is a huge distortion between the official media and reality,

Here is some raw and crude information to help you understand this reality. Let's begin...

Statement 1 . **Migrant Labor Force Participation**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 - In 2024, Mexicans born in the U.S. contributed $781 billion to the Gross Domestic Product (GDP), meaning that if they were an independent country, they would currently be the tenth largest economy in the world; while forecasts indicate that the Latino community could occupy third place in two or three years.

Myths or Reality?

The he argument of the Mexican government is based on the following calculation:

A. **Assumption 1**: Mexican-born residents - MBR - (ACS 2022):  11,710,000 people
B. **Assumption 2**: U.S. real GDP (2023, chained 2017): $22.671 Trillion USD (T-USD)
C. **Assumption 3**: Total U.S. population -TUP- (2023): 334,914,895 residents

Base just in this 3 assumtions, the Mexican government dares to make the following calculation that we present below:

.. math::

     ( \frac{11,710,000 MBR}{34,914,895 TUP} ) * $22.671 T-USD = 0.793 T-USD = $781 Billion USD

The result is 781 Billion USD ... itself is revelated revelated and as stated in the statement issued by the Mexican government. However, this is a MYTH. To perform these measurements, based on the three articles discussed at the beginning of this article, there is a way to address this scientific problem, and that is through measurement by GDP per person employed (at constant prices).

Even official institutions such as the World Bank and the OECD use "GDP per person employed at constant prices for a specific year" as a measure of labor productivity, reflecting output per worker rather than averaging the total population, which is what GDP per capita does.

And first one ...  why not use GDP per capita?

**Reason 1**: GDP per capita divides the economic pie equally among everyone, pretending that each citizen has an equal share. In reality, the gap between the rich and the rest can be enormous; this measure hides those differences and obscures the real economic problems.

**Reason 2**: It includes the unemployed and is distorted by demographics. GDP per capita includes everyone: children, retirees, and non-working people. This means that countries with young populations, aging societies, or high unemployment appear less productive than they actually are. Only GDP per worker shows how much each active taxpayer actually generates.

So next time you see that official number, remember: if you want to measure real economic power, don’t fall for the myth. Follow the GDP per person employed¡ For this calculation, we will update all the data, making extrapolations and refining the data. To begin, we have adjusted the data by adding the following values ​​to the data provided by the report.For this calculation, we will update all the data, making extrapolations and refining the data. To begin, we have adjusted the data by adding the following values ​​to the data provided by the report.

For this calculation, we'll update all the data, making extrapolations and refining them. To begin, we've adjusted the data by adding the following values ​​to the data provided in the report. Understanding that for this we need to calculate the labor force, it's important to calculate it. Unfortunately, and until we can obtain official data, even the Bureau in charge of accounting for the country's population movements doesn't have a clear idea of ​​the magnitude of the wave of immigrants in the country, and they even admit it, the quote adds. 

Based on that and the data provided by the FRED we have estimated the labor force rate as follows, looking for our most avid readers such as national fiscal and banking institutions and serious economic institutions to make their calculations and also those who read us from the comfort of the office, but enough enough returning to the adjustments, we consider the lack of data on the labor force rate by country of origin in the resident population of the United States we will use the general estimate offered by the FRED, with it and the previous elements, the assumptions are as follows:

For get the datasets for make the calcs we build this dataset base on this variables:


+-------------------+------------------+-------------------------------------------------------+---------------+
| Data Source       | Variable Code    | Description                                           | Unit          |

+-------------------+------------------+-------------------------------------------------------+---------------+
| Census.gov ACS    | B05006_xxxE      | Foreign-born population by country of birth           | Count         |

+-------------------+------------------+-------------------------------------------------------+---------------+
| FRED              | CNP16OV          | Civilian Noninstitutional Population (16+)            | Thousands     |

+-------------------+------------------+-------------------------------------------------------+---------------+


With this information we amplify the assumptions made by the Mexican government and will add additional elements to refine this analys adding as follow:

D. **Assumption 4**: EMP Ratio


This is a displayed the next calc for get the Assumption 4: :math:`EMP Ratio = \frac{Total U.S. population}{Total U.S. labor force}`.

Assum Assumption 4 is as follows:

.. raw:: html

    <iframe src="_static/employment_ratio_timeseries_2007_2025.html" width="700" height="450"></iframe>

By obtaining the EMP ratio, we can calculate, based on this estimator, the number of people by origin group within the United States that are part of the country's workforce. To do this, the following general formula will be used.


E. **Assumption 6**: Foreing-group LFC 

Base in alll asummptions we get the next adjust calc of the labor force of USA, for know that we build the next equation:

.. math::

 (X Foreing-group group) * EMP-RATIO = Foreing-group LFC


With all this ingredients we could calculate the contribution of GDP from Mexican-born LFC

F. **Contribution of GDP from Foreing-group LFC**

To calculate it and taking into account all the assumptions, it is as follows:

.. math::

 (\frac{X Foreing-group in LFC}{Total U.S. labor force}) * 100 = Contribution of GDP from Foreing-group LFC %

With all this Assumptions and recalibrate the datasets base from `U.S. Census Bureau <https://www.census.gov/>`_ and the `Federal Reserve's FRED <https://fred.stlouisfed.org>`_ database we get the next results:

.. raw:: html

    <iframe src="_static/gdp_employment_table_sorted_foreignonly_2024.html" width="6300" height="500"></iframe>

As we can see in the table ¨GDP & Employment Table by Foreign-Born Group (Excludes Native, 2024)¨ the calculation issued by the Mexican authority has a quite important variation since when considering the total population, as we have mentioned before, it generates distortions that distance us from reality, according to these results the statement of Mexicans born in the U.S. contributed $781 billion to the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) since their real contribution is ****$953.3 billion to the Gross Domestic Product (GDP)****












This is an inline equation: :math:`\frac{a}{b}`.

This is a displayed equation:
