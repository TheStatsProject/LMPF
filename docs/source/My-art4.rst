Forecasting Real GDP of the USA
===============================

This document outlines a methodology for forecasting the Real GDP of the United States using a time series model and the World Bank dataset. The analysis is performed using Python and leverages libraries such as `pandas`, `statsmodels`, and `matplotlib` for data processing, modeling, and visualization.

Objective
---------

The primary objective is to forecast the Real GDP of the United States over a specified horizon using historical data from the World Bank.

Methodology
-----------

The methodology involves the following steps:

1. **Data Collection**:
   - Download the World Bank dataset containing Real GDP data for the United States.

2. **Data Cleaning and Preparation**:
   - Parse and preprocess the dataset to prepare it for time series modeling.

3. **Time Series Modeling**:
   - Apply an ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) model to forecast future Real GDP values.

4. **Visualization**:
   - Plot the historical data along with the forecasted values.

Implementation
--------------

The following Python script implements the methodology:

.. code-block:: python

    import pandas as pd
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    from statsmodels.tsa.arima.model import ARIMA

    # Step 1: Load the World Bank Dataset
    url = "https://databank.worldbank.org/source/world-development-indicators"
    gdp_data = pd.read_csv('world_bank_gdp.csv')  # Replace with the actual file path
    gdp_data = gdp_data[gdp_data['Country Name'] == 'United States']

    # Step 2: Data Cleaning and Preparation
    gdp_data = gdp_data[['Year', 'Value']].rename(columns={'Value': 'GDP'})
    gdp_data['Year'] = pd.to_datetime(gdp_data['Year'], format='%Y')
    gdp_data.set_index('Year', inplace=True)

    # Step 3: Fit ARIMA Model for Forecasting
    model = ARIMA(gdp_data['GDP'], order=(1, 1, 1))  # Adjust order as needed
    model_fit = model.fit()

    # Step 4: Make Forecast
    forecast_steps = 5  # Forecast 5 years into the future
    forecast = model_fit.forecast(steps=forecast_steps)
    forecast_years = pd.date_range(start=gdp_data.index[-1], periods=forecast_steps + 1, freq='Y')[1:]
    forecast_series = pd.Series(forecast, index=forecast_years)

    # Step 5: Visualization
    plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
    plt.plot(gdp_data.index, gdp_data['GDP'], label='Historical GDP')
    plt.plot(forecast_series.index, forecast_series, label='Forecasted GDP', linestyle='--', color='red')
    plt.title('Real GDP Forecast for the USA')
    plt.xlabel('Year')
    plt.ylabel('Real GDP (USD)')
    plt.legend()
    plt.grid()
    plt.show()

Output and Analysis
-------------------

The script will produce the following:

- A plot displaying historical Real GDP values along with forecasted values for the next 5 years.
- Insights into the projected growth or decline of the Real GDP based on the ARIMA model.

Assumptions and Limitations
---------------------------

- The forecast is based solely on historical data and does not account for external shocks or policy changes.
- The ARIMA model assumes stationarity in the time series, which may not always hold true for economic data.

Future Enhancements
-------------------

- Incorporate additional explanatory variables (e.g., inflation, unemployment) to improve the forecasting model.
- Experiment with other time series models, such as SARIMA or Prophet, for better accuracy.
- Automate the data retrieval process directly from the World Bank API.

Conclusion
----------

This methodology demonstrates a straightforward approach to forecasting Real GDP using historical data and time series modeling. By refining the model and incorporating additional variables, the accuracy and reliability of the forecasts can be enhanced.
